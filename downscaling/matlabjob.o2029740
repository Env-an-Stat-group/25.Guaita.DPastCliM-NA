Setting up variables...
load and stack ESM data for the specified model
Done in 2.2 mins
create downscaled maps and observation maps (LR)
Loaded raw (ungridded) downscaled data
Aggregated stations that were in the same grid (and filtered them through the calibration dataset)
---> had 6708 calibration stations
---> now have 6002 stations
Starting parallel pool (parpool) using the 'Processes' profile ...
Preserving jobs with IDs: 4 because they contain crash dump files.
You can use 'delete(myCluster.Jobs)' to remove all jobs created with profile Processes. To create 'myCluster' use 'myCluster = parcluster('Processes')'.
Connected to parallel pool with 24 workers.
